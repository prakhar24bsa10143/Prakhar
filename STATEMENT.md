### Problem Statement  
In many small schools, tuition centers, and community libraries, book records are still maintained manually using paper registers. This leads to the following issues:  
- Difficulty in quickly checking whether a particular book is available or already issued  
- No proper tracking of who has borrowed which book  
- Frequent loss of books or delays in return  
- Time-consuming manual searching of books and members  

There is a clear need for a simple, lightweight, and easy-to-use automated system that can manage books and borrowing activities without requiring internet, database installation, or complex setup.

### Scope of the Project  
This project implements a **console-based Library Management System** using Core Java.  
The system is intentionally kept minimal so that it can be easily understood, modified, and submitted as an academic OOP project.  
All data is stored in memory (using ArrayList) — no file or database persistence is implemented in the current version (can be added as future enhancement).

### Target Users  
- Librarians of small schools/colleges  
- Students managing department/library society books  
- Teachers who need a simple demo system for classroom explanation  
- Any individual managing a personal or community book collection

### High-Level Features  
1. **Add new books** (Title + unique ISBN)  
2. **Register new library members**  
3. **Borrow a book** using ISBN (book status changes to “Not Available”)  
4. **Return a book** using ISBN (book status changes back to “Available”)  
5. **View all books** with real-time availability status  
6. **Simple menu-driven interface** with clear prompts and error messages  
7. **Instant testing** using pre-loaded sample data  

This system successfully demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, collections, methods, and clean code structure while solving a real-world problem in the simplest possible way.
